# Color detection

**1. Setup Requirement**

install these libraries: opencv-python, numpy

    pip3 install opencv-python
    pip3 install numpy   

**2. Where to begin**

  There are **two main files** in here: colorDetection.py, targetLocate.py

  You can start with colorDetection.py which detects the shape color and letter color of a target.

  Let say we want to pass the img_020_tar_001.jpg

Its relative path is /img_020_tar_001.jpg. So you may set the values for folderPath and imgName_list as follow:
